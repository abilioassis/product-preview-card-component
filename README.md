## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS 3
- Flexbox

### What I learned

Not all content present in HTML needs to be displayed at all times.

For example, depending on the screen size (desktop and mobile) the component image changes.

I placed the two images in the HTML and in the CSS I controlled the visibility using the display property.

To be able to reproduce exactly the component design made in Figma it is necessary to pay close attention to all the spacing details (margins, padding, height and width).

When developing code for mobile it is useful to open the .css file in two windows side by side. The desktop code is displayed in a window. And in the other window the mobile code is displayed.

I learned how to use GitHub Pages.
